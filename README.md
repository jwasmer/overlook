## Introduction
  The user will be shown a login page before entering the site. The username must be "customer50" (the number 50 can be replaced with any valid user id, currently only 1-50 are valid user ids), and the password is "overlook2021".

  Upon entering the correct credentials, the user will be shown a dashboard page containing a calendar widget and can search for available rooms based on the date selected in the widget. The user is offered an additional option to filter based on room type. Additionally, they can click on a "View Bookings" menu to display a history of all bookings they've made at the Grand Overlook. The top righthand corner of the page displays a small "Welcome, user!" message.

  Upon submitting their search, a user will be shown a list of rooms organized by room type. They can click a room, enabling the "Select Button" and updating it to a "Book Now" button. Clicking "Book Now" will save their booking and display a confirmation popup.

## Challenges
This was a relatively tight timeline. Unfortunately, some features had to be cut from the final product.
- "Manager" iteration would been done at the expense of improving error handling and updating class tests
- Focusing on page accessibility required a rework of the select-a-room functionality that displays after a date is searched. Properly updating the HTML to render elements tab-friendly ate up a much larger amount of time than I had budgeted.
- Building proper error handling feels resource-intensive for the relatively low incidence it will be used. It's very impactful when it is needed, but it's taken more time than expected.


## Wins
I was expecting working with API calls to be more problematic. Something clicked between my previous project and this project, though, and building the API calls was almost entirely pain-free.
